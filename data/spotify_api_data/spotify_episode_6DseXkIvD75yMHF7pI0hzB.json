Next, we learn why Pascal believed it was impossible to arrive at scientific truth, and how this led him to develop the foundations of probability theory. Finally, we discuss \"expected value\" and how Barack Obama utilized it to secure his residency in the White House and avoid living underneath a freeway overpass.
