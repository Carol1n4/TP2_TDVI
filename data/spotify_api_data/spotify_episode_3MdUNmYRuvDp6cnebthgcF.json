Kennedy Jr. is an environmental attorney, activist, founder of the Children\u2019s Health Defense, the author of The Real Anthony Fauci (All proceeds of his book go to the Children\u2019s Health Defense), and a 2024 candidate for the office of The President of the United States.  Dr. Jack Kruse is a neurosurgeon who had an awakening in 2007 when he suffered a torn meniscus in his knee at 6\u20192\u201d, 357 lbs. This led to his further study of physics, light, magnetism, and electricity. He ultimately concluded that modern medicine lacked a deep understanding of how humans function in relation to the natural world.
