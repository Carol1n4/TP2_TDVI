Billie Joe Armstrong, Mike Dirnt and Tr\u00e9 Cool have been playing music together since 1987. They\u2019ve sold over 90 million records. They\u2019ve won four Grammys, including twice for Best Rock Album. They put out their first album in 1990, and their second album, Kerplunk!, in 1991. And then, they moved to a major label and in 1994 they put out their third album, Dookie, which was huge. It helped bring punk into the mainstream. And this month is its 30th anniversary. So for this episode, I talked to Billie Joe Armstrong about the making of one of Green Day\u2019s biggest hits of all time: \u201cBasket Case.\"  Coming up, you\u2019ll also hear from Rob Cavallo, who produced the album. Plus, you\u2019ll hear two different demo versions of \u201cBasket Case,\u201d the first of which is basically a totally different song.  Billie Joe Amstrong traces the history of \u201cBasket Case,\u201d from its origins as a cassette recording in a punk basement, all the way to becoming a song that helped define an era of music.
