Rick Rubin last spoke to John back in April when the Chili Peppers were getting ready to release their album,\u00a0Unlimited Love, their first record with Frusciante in 16 years.\u00a0Unlimited Love\u00a0debuted at number one in the U.S. and 15 other countries. Today, just a little more than six months later, the Chili Peppers released a second Rick Rubin-produced album,\u00a0Return Of The Dream Canteen. On today\u2019s episode we\u2019ll hear John Frusciante talk about the band\u2019s early music, including the making of\u00a0Blood Sugar Sex Magik.\u00a0They talk about how his contributions on slower, more melodic songs like \u201cUnder The Bridge\u201d and \u201cBreaking The Girl\u201d helped expand the Chili Peppers funk punk sound. John also talks candidly about the dark, drug-addicted years that followed the intense success of\u00a0Blood Sugar. And he explains how he was able to finally get sober and rejoin the Chili Peppers to record their classic, commercial comeback album,\u00a0Californication.
