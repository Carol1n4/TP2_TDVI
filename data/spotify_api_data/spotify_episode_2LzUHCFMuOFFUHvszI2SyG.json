On this episode, we learn about Epicureanism\u2014one of four schools of thought that were prevalent during the Hellenistic Age, which will be our focus for the next few episodes. We find out why Diogenes liked Epicurus\u2019 ideas so much that he permanently graffitied them onto the walls of an ancient greek community center. We also learn why Epicurus thought that the most satisfying part of eating a half gallon of ice cream was the moment after the last spoonful, and why a jacket from Nordstrom really isn\u2019t that much better than a jacket from Target. All this and more on the latest episode of Philosophize This!  Thank you so much for listening!
