He was raised among siblings who were largely involved in acting, including his late brother, River Phoenix, alongside whom he began his acting career in the 1980s. He made his big-screen debut in SpaceCamp (1986), and he earned his first starring role in the Cold War drama Russkies (1987). Phoenix is known for his commitment to embody each of his roles, particularly in his role as Arthur Fleck in Todd Phillips\u2019 Joker, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor. His filmography includes powerful performances in Gladiator, Her, You Were Never Really Here, Walk the Line\u2013where he won a Golden Globe for his portrayal of Johnny Cash\u2013and most recently, Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux. In addition to his acting career, Phoenix is an animal rights activist and has taken up producing films like Gunda, and he continues to leave an indelible mark on the world of cinema.  ------ Thank you to the sponsors that fuel our podcast and our team:  Squarespace https://squarespace.com/tetra Use code 'TETRA' ------ Vivo Barefoot http://vivobarefoot.com/tetra Use code 'TETRA' ------ LMNT Electrolytes https://drinklmnt.com/tetra Use code 'TETRA' ------ House of Macadamias https://www.houseofmacadamias.com/tetra Use code 'TETRA' ------ Sign up to receive Tetragrammaton Transmissions https://www.tetragrammaton.com/join-newsletter", "duration_ms": 7947572, "explicit": false, "external_urls": {"spotify": "https://open.spotify.com/episode/4K3RHatOsmLWzjmXk7T1ci"}, "href": "https://api.spotify.com/v1/episodes/4K3RHatOsmLWzjmXk7T1ci", "html_description": "<p>Joaquin Phoenix is widely regarded as one of the best actors of his generation, known for his intense and eccentric on-screen portrayals in period dramas, thrillers, and psychological films.
