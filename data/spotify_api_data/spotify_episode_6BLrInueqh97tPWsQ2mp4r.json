This week's episode has a guest that some of you have come to know and appreciate, and some of you hopefully will after this episode \u2014 Andrew Goodman-Bacon (\u201cBacon\u201d).  In addition to having a great nickname, he also has a great job, a great personality and several great papers, one of which after only two years since publication has won an award at the Journal of Econometrics, and already has over 4,000 cites.  I really wish I knew how to pull things from google scholar and I could see what other papers in the history of econometrics have had such a meteoric rise in terms of impact and influence.  It\u2019s been unusually impactful, though, let\u2019s just say.  I have a hunch Bacon wasn\u2019t given the \u201cMost Likely to Actually Use Math After High School\u201d award in high school.  But as it turns out, he has, and has become a really great applied economist who works on topics both in econometrics, but also public policy and economic history.  The trifecta.  But a few years ago, he left academia to go work for the Federal Reserve in Minneapolis at the Opportunity & Inclusive Growth Institute.  This interview was a real delight; it even involves Dungeons & Dragons and throwing knives.  Scott's Substack is a reader-supported publication.

But now some of us better understand it and while Bacon isn\u2019t the only one who helped advance that knowledge, he was one of them.  So I hope you enjoy this interview, and if you\u2019re interested in learning more about difference-in-differences, don\u2019t forget to check out Brant Callaway\u2019s workshop on Mixtape Sessions tonight!
