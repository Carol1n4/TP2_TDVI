We first discuss Al Kindi and what he would have to say about modern day news organizations and their approach to reporting the \u201ctruth.\u201d Then, we learn about Al Ghazali, who at one point became so skeptical about our ability to discover the truth, he actually made himself physically ill. Lastly, we take a look at Averroes who desperately wanted philosophy and religion to be business partners. All this and more on the latest episode of Philosophize This!
