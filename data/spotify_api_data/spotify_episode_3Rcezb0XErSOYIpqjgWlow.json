Recently, the University of Chicago Press published a book entitled The Economic Approach: Unpublished Writings of Gary S. Becker.  It was written obviously by Gary Becker who died almost 10 years ago at the age of 83 after an extremely long and fruitful career as an economist.  Dr. Becker had many students \u2014 some like me were students from afar, but some, like our guest today, were his actual students.  And today\u2019s guest is Casey Mulligan, one of the editors of that aforementioned book, and a professor of economics at the University of Chicago.  This was a fun interview to do.  Casey walked us through his time at Harvard as an undergrad to his unusually rapid progression through Chicago\u2019s economics PhD program where he stayed on and is now a professor.  We discussed his own career but we also spent just a lot of time discussing what it was like with Becker, as well as his own later time at the Council of Economic Advisers.  I hope you enjoy it!Scott's Substack is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.
