We begin by asking ourselves whether or not Stephen\u2019s English bulldog Charlie is part of God, and analyzing the implications of our answer. Next, we discuss the concept of \u201csubstance\u201d and what Spinoza thought the only one true substance was (hint: it\u2019s not water). Finally, we consider how Spinoza\u2019s concept of God/Nature impacts his thoughts on free will and why he would say Stephen has no choice but to imitate a drunk person singing \u201cI Love Rock and Roll\u201d every time he drives past that certain billboard. All this and more on the latest episode of Philosophize This!  Thank you so much for listening!
