I\u2019m your host - Scott Cunningham, a professor at Baylor in their economics department.  This week's guest is with none other than Amy Finkelstein, the John Bates Clark award and MacArthur Genius grant winner, and professor of economics at MIT. This was a fun interview \u2014 super generous, giving guest who shared a lot of her life, how she grew up in New York and then through her own windy road found her way to economics.  She has a new book out \u201cWe\u2019ve Got You Covered: Rebooting American Health Care\u201d (with Liran Einav).I loved this interview.  We talked about the Oregon Medicaid Experiment, which I talk about in my book in the instrumental variables chapter when discussing lotteries. She shares where that idea came from, and it was super exciting to hear about that.
