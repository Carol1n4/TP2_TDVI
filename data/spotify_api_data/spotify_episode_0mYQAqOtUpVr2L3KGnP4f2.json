Alvin Roth is the 2012 winner of the Nobel Prize in economics and professor of economics at Stanford University.  He is a widely regarded and extremely innovative game theorist who uses game theory not only to understand the world but to improve it.  Those improvements broadly are grouped under a field we now call \"market design\", but it has included helping design kidney exchange policies that can help address kidney shortages, helping redesign the allocation of physicians to hospitals and residencies, and much more. A humble man who is as I say in the interview kinder than he is smart, which given he won the Nobel Prize says a lot about both. Always a joy to talk with this man. I hope you feel so too.
