We first discuss what it meant to pursue knowledge during\u00a0the time Francis Bacon lived and why he thought that scientific advancement should be society\u2019s chief priority. Next, we examine Bacon\u2019s \u201cFour Idols of the Mind,\u201d which were the biases he believed prevented humans from thinking scientifically. We touch on everything from germ theory to diet fads to healthcare reform to gender inequality, with some Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos thrown in for good measure.
