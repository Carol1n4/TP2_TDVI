I\u2019ve never tried making a posthumous episode before, because hearing directly from the artist is at the heart of Song Exploder. But with all the interview archives that they have of him speaking, plus all the isolated tracks from the recordings, and the original demo, it actually seemed possible. So this is a very different and special episode of the show.  In September 1969, John Lennon told the rest of the Beatles that he was leaving the group. Their breakup was announced publicly in April 1970, and that December, John Lennon released his first solo album, John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band. The Plastic Ono band was the name for a rotating group of musicians that John and his wife, the artist Yoko Ono, had put together. For the making of \u201cGod,\u201d the band included Ringo Starr on drums, Billy Preston on piano, and Klaus Voormann on bass. I got to interview Klaus Voormann about his experiences making this track, and in this episode, you\u2019ll hear from him along with the archival interviews with John Lennon, Ringo Starr, and Billy Preston. You\u2019ll also hear the original demo for \u201cGod,\u201d and outtakes from the recording sessions at Abbey Road studios. They recorded the final version of this song on October 9, 1970\u2014John Lennon\u2019s 30th birthday.  Archival audio sources: - John Lennon's audio was excerpted from an interview with\u00a0Rolling Stone's\u00a0Jann S. Wenner, recorded on December 8, 1970. The full interview can be found\u00a0here. With grateful thanks to Jann S. Wenner for his permission and collaboration.  - Arthur Janov and Billy Preston's quotes came from interviews conducted in 2005 owned by Yoko Ono Lennon. With grateful thanks to Yoko Ono Lennon for her permission and collaboration.  - Ringo Starr's audio came from the 2008\u00a0Classic Albums documentary\u00a0on\u00a0John Lennon /\u00a0Plastic Ono Band, directed by Matthew Longfellow.
