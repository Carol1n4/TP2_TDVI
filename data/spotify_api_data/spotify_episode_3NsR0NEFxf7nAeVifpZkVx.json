The reason?  The way researchers had been used it probably wasn't right because they'd been using the wrong tools to do it. One of those econometricians was the brilliant Sophie Sun, a recent graduate of MIT's famous economics department who with Sarah Abraham worked on the problem of analyzing what are called \"event studies\" using a traditional version of the ordinary least squares model called \"twoway fixed effects\".  This paper both helped expose problems with that approach, but graciously, also proposed solutions.  A shot heard around the world!
