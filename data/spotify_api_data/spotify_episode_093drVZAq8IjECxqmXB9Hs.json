But like many things during the pandemic, COVID didn\u2019t necessarily cause these structural breakdowns as much as it exposed just how broken the system was to begin with.\u00a0  Nowhere is that more clear than in our episode today about why 65% of American fourth grade kids can barely read. And about how during the pandemic, parents, for the first time, came face to face with just how bad and ineffective the reading instruction in their kids\u2019 classrooms is and started asking questions about why.
