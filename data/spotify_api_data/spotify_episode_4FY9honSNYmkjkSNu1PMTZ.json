Published in 2003, Abadie's model identifies causal effects of broad social interventions when experimentation is practically impossible.  He tells the story about how he became interested in terrorism, which was the impetus of the creation of the method in the first place (and which obviously cannot be randomized), as well as his thoughts about econometrics more generally.  A brilliant and interesting man, expect him to one day win the Nobel Prize.  Get ahead of that future wave by learning more about him now.
