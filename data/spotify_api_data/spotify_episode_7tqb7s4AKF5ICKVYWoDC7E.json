His newest project, The Sympathizer, an HBO miniseries based on the 2015 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name, has Downey Jr. taking on multiple roles simultaneously.  Born into a family of filmmakers, Downey Jr. began acting as a child actor in his father's independent films, then entered mainstream Hollywood in the 1980s. His portrayal of the legendary Charlie Chaplin in the 1992 biopic Chaplin earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. After a period of personal struggles with substance abuse, Downey conquered his addiction, dedicated himself to sobriety, and made a remarkable professional resurgence. His starring roles as Tony Stark/Iron Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, in the action-adventure Sherlock Holmes, and in the action comedy Tropic Thunder catapulted him to global stardom. To date, Downey has appeared in over 70 movies, which have grossed over $14 billion, making Downey one of the highest-grossing actors of all time.\u00a0  ------ Thank you to the sponsors that fuel our podcast and our team:  Lucy https://lucy.co/tetra ------ LMNT Electrolytes https://drinklmnt.com/tetra ------ Squarespace https://squarespace.com/tetra ------ House of Macadamias https://www.houseofmacadamias.com/tetra", "duration_ms": 8399882, "explicit": false, "external_urls": {"spotify": "https://open.spotify.com/episode/7tqb7s4AKF5ICKVYWoDC7E"}, "href": "https://api.spotify.com/v1/episodes/7tqb7s4AKF5ICKVYWoDC7E", "html_description": "<p>Robert Downey Jr. is an actor and producer whose critically acclaimed performance as Lewis Strauss in Christopher Nolan&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15398776/?nmbio_sal_1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oppenheimer</a> earned him an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, and a BAFTA Award.
