He has gained acclaim for his roles in movies like Fight Club, American History X, and Primal Fear. In all, he has written, directed, produced, or starred in over 50 movies. His off-screen interests and achievements in environmental activism and social entrepreneurship are just as substantial: he serves as the president of the American branch of the Maasai Wilderness Conservation Trust, an award-winning environmental conservation organization. Additionally, he was appointed the first United Nations Goodwill Ambassador for Biodiversity. In 2010, he founded Crowdrise (acquired by GoFundMe), a platform fostering grassroots fundraising to champion various social and environmental initiatives.  ------ Thank you to the sponsors that fuel our podcast and our team:  LMNT Electrolytes https://drinklmnt.com/tetra ------ House of Macadamias https://www.houseofmacadamias.com/tetra ------ Squarespace https://squarespace.com/tetra", "duration_ms": 11563598, "explicit": false, "external_urls": {"spotify": "https://open.spotify.com/episode/3JsY71lr2w4cHAx3zagWDI"}, "href": "https://api.spotify.com/v1/episodes/3JsY71lr2w4cHAx3zagWDI", "html_description": "<p>Edward Norton is one of the great actors of his generation.
