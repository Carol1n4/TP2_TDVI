We first discuss how a case of 16th century road rage led to a near-death experience which ironically helped Montaigne overcome his fear of dying. Next, we learn why Montaigne valued personal experience above all other evidence, and how his philosophy drew from the four dominant schools of thought of the Hellenistic age. Finally, we find out why Montaigne thought that \u201cto philosophize is to learn how to die,\u201d and how he believed this idea could be put into practice. All this and more on the latest episode of Philosophize This!  Thank you so much for listening!
